# PsynaryML

Psynary is a small repositorie where I can share the basic code I'm using for predictions on the Psynary datase.

This is just a small extraction of the different versions of the code, so it's not tidy or very comprehensible,
but the proces is not very complicated.

All questions to eduardo@psynary.com
